Hello, I have made a C based chat server and client for linux, based on a video by [gist.github.com/nir9](https://gist.github.com/nir9), following this video I used the manual pages and 
documentation to try and attempt this on my own, with the video as reference to correct any errors. The code is basically the same so I do not take much credit for this,
it was mainly for practice.
